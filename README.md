# Digi-Farm

## Project Overview

#### What is Digi-Farm?

Digi-Farm is a website where farmers can go to get helpful information and advice about farming. Instead of farmers having to guess or rely only on what they learned from their parents, they can use Digi-Farm to make smarter decisions about their crops.


#### The Problem It Solves


Many small-scale farmers in Kenya face challenges like:

Not knowing when to plant - Should I plant now or wait for rain?
Dealing with pests - What is eating my crops and how do I stop it?
Getting the timing right - When should I harvest to get the best yield?
Learning from experience alone - They have no way to learn what other farmers are doing

__Digi-Farm__ fixes these problems by giving farmers access to:

* Real-time weather information
* Guidance on when to plant, weed, and harvest
* Information about common pests and how to treat them
* Tips and advice from other farmers in their community


#### How Digi-Farm Works

__1. Farmers Create an Account__

A farmer goes to Digi-Farm and signs up
They enter their location, phone number, and which crops they grow
They can now access everything the platform offers

__2. They Check the Weather__

The farmer checks the weather forecast for their area
They see temperature, rainfall predictions, and humidity
This helps them decide: "Should I water today? Is rain coming?"

__3. They Follow the Crop Calendar__

The farmer can see what activities they should do this month
For example: "March is planting season for maize - plant now!"
The app shows exactly what to do and when to do it

__4. They Learn About Pests__

If a farmer sees an unknown insect on their crop, they can search for it
Digi-Farm shows them what the pest is called
It explains the symptoms to look for
It tells them how to prevent the pest from spreading
It suggests treatments (chemicals or natural methods)

__5. They Share Tips With Other Farmers__

Farmers can post tips they've learned (like "Intercropping beans with maize saves water")
Other farmers can read these tips
Farmers can like tips they find helpful
This creates a community of learning
